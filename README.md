# WebBroswer-iOS-App
A simple interactive application built in order to understand the basic working of views, tables, images, `webkit` and navigation controller, implemented using various Object Oriented Programming concepts, built using `Swift`, `Swift UIKit` and `XCode`. The application acts a miniature of an actual web browser, enabling us to surf through a few limited pages.

## About the Application :
A simple interactive application built in order to understand the basic working of views, tables, images and navigation controller, implemented using various Object Oriented Programming concepts, built using `Swift`, `Swift UIKit` and `XCode`. The application is part of a learning program done to understand the basic of iOS development and simple concepts involved in it.
- **List Screen** :
  - It acts as the home page of the app.
  - It provides a list of websites that can be accessed using the browser.
  - Choosing of anyone triggers a transition that redirects the user to the desired webpage.
  - The page is basically implemented using the `TableView` in `Swift UIKit` with a single column and the the website names displayed in each cell.
  - The page also provides the feature to share the webpage using the activity controller.
  
- **Page Screen** :
  - The screen basically displays the webpage of the chosen site.
  - The provision of a common navigation controller enable the user to switch back to the home page.
  - The page also provides the feature to switch to other default pages using the quick button present in the top rigth corner.
  - The page also provides features to move back, forward and reload the pages.
  
- **Graphical Features** :
  - The project contains **multiple graphical content** ranging from _bending of borders_ to _styled fonts_, _contrasting colour switches_, _pictures_ and _eye-soothing layout_.
  - The UI at the same time does not compromise on interactivity.
  - The application provides and simple yet compromising transition between table view and image view.
  
- **Swift and UIKit** :
  - The `Swift` and `Swift UIKit` play the most significal role, driving the entire application.
  - The entire application is built up on various inbuilt and user defined data structures used to represent various views.
  - Various other inbuilt header files and inbuilt views are used to reach higher capabilities.
  - The application displays example of transition of views over the navigation controller and the use of image and table views and the use of  `Webkit`.
