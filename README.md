# WebBroswer-iOS-App
A simple interactive application built in order to understand the basic working of views, tables, images and navigation controller, implemented using various Object Oriented Programming concepts, built using `Swift`, `Swift UIKit` and `XCode`. The application acts a miniature of an actual web browser, enabling us to surf through a few limited pages.
